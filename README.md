# street-sign-object-detection-with-yolov8
Street sign object detection with yolov8 i google colab (training) and wsl (implementation)

Dataset used in this practice is from [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/), author https://universe.roboflow.com/selfdriving-car-qtywx/self-driving-cars-lfjou/dataset/6

Step 1: Using a pretrained model and training it on a custom dataset (street signs) - transfer learning in Google Colab
Step 2: Downloading weights from Google Colab and importing them into a local Jupyter notebook
Step 3: Testing our model in Jupyter notebook
